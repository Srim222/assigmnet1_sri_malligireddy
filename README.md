Dynamic PHP Resume
This project is a dynamic resume web page built with PHP for an assignment. The resume uses PHP variables and arrays to store personal information, contact details, a summary, and a list of skills. The skills section is generated dynamically using a PHP foreach loop.

Features
Personal details (name, email, phone) are displayed using PHP variables.
The summary section is populated from a PHP variable.
The skills list in the sidebar is generated dynamically from a PHP array.
Clean, responsive layout using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
Easy to update: just change the variables at the top of the PHP file.
How to Use
Open Sri_maligireddy.php in a code editor.
Edit the PHP variables at the top of the file to update your name, email, phone, summary, and skills.
Place the file and the assets folder on a PHP-enabled server or use XAMPP/Laragon for local testing.
Open the file in your browser to view your dynamic resume.
Assignment Requirements Met

Used PHP echo statements inside HTML (not inside echo).
Converted the skills list to a PHP foreach loop.
Kept all CSS, Bootstrap, and layout unchanged.
No HTML inside echo statements.
Indentation and syntax follow best practices.
