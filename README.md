# Dynamic PHP Resume

This project is a **dynamic resume web page** built with PHP for an assignment. The resume uses **PHP variables and arrays** to store personal information, contact details, a summary, and a list of skills. The skills section is generated dynamically using a **PHP foreach loop**.

## **Features**
- **Personal Details:** Name, email, and phone are displayed using PHP variables.  
- **Summary Section:** Populated from a PHP variable.  
- **Dynamic Skills List:** The sidebar skills list is generated from a PHP array using a PHP foreach loop.  
- **Clean, Responsive Layout:** Uses Bootstrap and custom CSS.  
- **Easy to Update:** Simply change the variables at the top of the PHP file to update your information.
